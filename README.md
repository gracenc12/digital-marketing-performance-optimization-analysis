## 1. Business Context & Problem

A digital marketing agency manages advertising performance data across **Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, and Google Ads**.
While engagement metrics (CTR) are strong, profitability remains inconsistent due to inefficient budget allocation, seasonality effects, and lack of standardized campaign execution.

The key business problem is **how to convert high engagement into sustainable profit** by identifying the right timing, industry focus, and operational strategy for scaling ad spend.

* **April (Festive Period):** Highest revenue but lowest ROAS → ads should focus on *Awareness*.
* **July:** Highest ROAS → best period for creative testing.
* **Week 5 Payday:** Consistent **+22% revenue uplift**, ideal for budget scaling.
* **Beauty & FMCG** show the most stable efficiency (ROAS ~0.81).
